// This program takes a string representing a price in pence
// The program then builds up a string representing the price in pounds

// You need to do a step-by-step breakdown of each line in this program
// Try and describe the purpose / rationale behind each step

// To begin, we can start with
// 1. const penceString = "399p": initialises a string variable with the value "399p"

// Answers: In line 1, a variable "penceString" was created holding the value "399p"

// 3-6. substring(0, penceString.length - 1):
// the first argument is the start index, so 0 means the first character
// penceString.length is 4 because there are 4 characters, at indexes 0 to 3
// the second argument is the end index and it is exclusive, it stops just before that position
// length - 1 is 3, so it stops before index 3, dropping the "p" and leaving "399"

// 8. padStart(3, "0") pads the start until the string is at least 3 characters long
// "399" is already 3, so nothing gets added here

// Line 9-12 created a variable "pounds" and used the subString(0, paddedPenceNumberString.length - 2 ) 
// to start count from 0 of the "penceStringWithoutTrailingP" value which is 399. 
// It further removed the last two number in the value by checking the length of the value with "paddedPenceNumberString.length" 
// And subtracting 2 (3 - 2), because length - 2 subtract 2 from the character/value count. Cutting out 99 and leaving the value to remain 3.

// Line 14-16 created a variable "pence", using the subString(paddedPenceNumberString.length - 2) 
// to check the length of the value of the variable "paddedPenceNumberString" which remain 399 from line 8
// substring(length - 2) takes the last 2 characters of the padded value, giving us the pence (99)
// padEnd(2, "0") makes sure the value is at least 2 characters long, adding "0" if it is shorter
// in this case the pence value is already 2 characters ("99"), so padEnd adds nothing

// Line 18 printed our codes a formatted style adding the pound sign "£"
